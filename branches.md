(This is a modifcation to branches.md for the first branch in "edits") A git branch is essentially a copy of the main or master file that you can make alterations to with out changing the main branch. You can use it to test out changes to the code in the branch to then later go back to the main file with out any of those changes being commited to the main file. Or if you want to keep the changes made to the branch, once you've tested out the code you can merge it back to the main file. This is useful if you want to test out changes, additions, or bug fixes to the code.
